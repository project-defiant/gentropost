# Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

Working with Genome Wide Associations Studies (GWAS) most of people will encounter a term called `Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium`. In this post I would like to explain to myself and all of you readers, what does it mean.

First a bit of statistics :(

Let's think of **binomial distribution** with following formula $Bin(2,f)$ where:

-   $2$ represents number of possible states, that the sample can occur in. In terms of SNP imagine this as a thesis (SNP exists or SNP does not exist).

-   $f$ represents the probability of the positive thesis appearing. In terms of an SNP this will be it's allele frequency.

Also denote the assumption that $f+f' = 1$, and

-   $f$ - frequency of allele 1

-    $f'$ - frequency of allele 2

and total sum of all possible alleles in given population should be then the sum of allele frequencies.

$$
f + f' = 1 
$$

Where 1 means 100% of all alleles in the population. This will incline that the probability of obtaining 2 $f$ alleles is going to be $f^2$ , two $f'$ alleles as $f'^2$ and one copy of each allele as $2ff'$ . We can see it clearly by expanding the original formula by quadratic equation.

$$
f + f' = 1
$$

$$
f^2 + 2ff' + f'^2 = 1^2
$$

Now we can create a matrix of conditions for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium.

| genotype | probability                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| $11$     | $f^2$                               |
| $12$     | $2ff'$ or $2f(1-f)$                 |
| $22$     | $f'^2$ or $(1-f)(1-f)$ or $(1-f)^2$ |
