    "text": "Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium\nWorking with Genome Wide Associations Studies (GWAS) most of people will encounter a term called Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. In this post I would like to explain to myself and all of you readers, what does it mean.\nFirst a bit of statistics :(\nLet’s think of binomial distribution with following formula \\(Bin(2,f)\\) where:\n\n\\(2\\) represents number of possible states, that the sample can occur in. In terms of SNP imagine this as a thesis (SNP exists or SNP does not exist).\n\\(f\\) represents the probability of the positive thesis appearing. In terms of an SNP this will be it’s allele frequency.\n\nAlso denote the assumption that \\(f+f' = 1\\), and\n\n\\(f\\) - frequency of allele 1\n\\(f'\\) - frequency of allele 2\n\nand total sum of all possible alleles in given population should be then the sum of allele frequencies.\n\\[\nf + f' = 1\n\\]\nWhere 1 means 100% of all alleles in the population. This will incline that the probability of obtaining 2 \\(f\\) alleles is going to be \\(f^2\\) , two \\(f'\\) alleles as \\(f'^2\\) and one copy of each allele as \\(2ff'\\) . We can see it clearly by expanding the original formula by quadratic equation.\n\\[\nf + f' = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nf^2 + 2ff' + f'^2 = 1^2\n\\]\nNow we can create a matrix of conditions for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium.\n\n\n\ngenotype\nprobability\n\n\n\n\n\\(11\\)\n\\(f^2\\)\n\n\n\\(12\\)\n\\(2ff'\\) or \\(2f(1-f)\\)\n\n\n\\(22\\)\n\\(f'^2\\) or \\((1-f)(1-f)\\) or \\((1-f)^2\\)"
